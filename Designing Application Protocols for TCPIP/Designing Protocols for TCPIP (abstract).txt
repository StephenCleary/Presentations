Most TCP/IP protocols are poorly designed. Surprised? HTTP and FTP have changed over the years, and newer protocols such as WebSockets are designed much more carefully.

This language-agnostic talk will teach you everything you need to know about how to communicate over raw TCP/IP sockets. You'll learn about the three essential pillars of TCP/IP protocols: Connections, Message Framing, and Keepalives.

With the embedded devices and the Internet of Things skyrocketing, proper TCP/IP communication has never been more important. This session will teach you how to use TCP/IP sockets effectively to communicate with any kind of device.
