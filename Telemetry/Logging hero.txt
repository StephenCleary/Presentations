On-call alerts and user bug reports can be annoying, but they don't have to be! Imagine if your application was already instrumented with all the logging and tracing you need to easily track down issues... This talk has the capability of granting you Hero Status within your organization!

We'll cover the forms of modern telemetry for .NET applications. Starting with centralized semantic logging, we'll emphasize the secret sauce that will make your coworkers love you: semantic logging scopes! Once you see them in action, you'll never want to be without them!

Other forms of telemetry are also included. Leaning into the Open Telemetry standard, we'll cover how to add metric measurements and timings into your application with extremely low overhead.

We'll also cover techniques for distributed tracing, including the standard span-based approach as well as linking techniques for disassociated backend processors.

Throughout this talk, we'll cover common visualization tools that are compatible with your newly-instrumented applications. Azure Application Insights will be included, along with free OSS solutions.

By the end of this talk, you'll have concrete ideas to take back to your day job, earning you the respect and heartfelt thanks of anyone who has to track down issues in your website or client application!
