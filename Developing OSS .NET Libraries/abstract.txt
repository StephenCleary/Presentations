This session covers everything technical you need to know about writing .NET open source libraries that support the latest platforms, including NetStandard targets, NuGet, continuous deployment, and source-level debugging.

This session starts with a discussion of the current landscape of .NET open source, with a particular examination of how .NET Core (and NetStandard) impacts library design. We’ll examine .NET Core mainly from the library developer perspective but also consider the platform developer and application developer perspectives. We'll then cover modern tools and techniques you can use today in your .NET open source projects. NuGet is a given for .NET. We'll explores how NuGet supports .NET Core and I'll share tips for working with continuous integration and deployment systems (using AppVeyor, for example).

We'll conclude by looking at the current state of debugging .NET open source libraries, reviewing the standard SymbolSource approach as well as newer approaches such as GitLink and demonstrating how to ensure that the consumers of our packages can do so with the greatest of ease. You’ll leave with a firm understanding of the best practices and future direction of modern .NET open source libraries.
