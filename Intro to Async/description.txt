(Re-)Learn modern async/await - everything you need to know!



Now's your chance to (re-)learn async/await, as it applies to modern code. This brand-new talk not only covers asynchronous programming with async/await and the standard techniques and best practices; it also covers how to use *new* types such as `ValueTask<T>` and `Channels`. We'll touch on concurrency, cancellation, progress reporting, and asynchronous streams to round out a complete introduction to modern asynchronous code.

You'll leave this session with the skills necessary to write asynchronous code that takes full advantage of modern techniques. This session is applicable to those who have not yet learned async/await, those who use async/await without a good understanding of them, and those who have learned async/await well but are wondering if there are better, more modern techniques for some common scenarios.
